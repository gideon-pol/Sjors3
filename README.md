# Sjors3 rendering engine
A very simple rendering engine made in OpenGL with Glad

## Overview
This engine is by no means efficient or finished, but it does have a number of features such as:
- Directional and point light
- Materials
- Normal mapping
- Post processing
- Skyboxes
- Directional shadow mapping (for 1 light only)
- Object and component system
- Input handling

Future improvements could include:
- Shadow mapping for multiple lights
- Customizable shader per material
- Deferred rendering
- Scripting environment
